# Word frequency histogram

Write a standalone program that will display (using ASCII art) a
histogram of word frequencies from one or more text files (or from
`stdin`).

Your program should be insensitive to case, so it should consider
"FOO" and "foo" as "the same".

You should submit your work in the form of a URL to a publicly
accessible `git` repository, which should include the source and a
`README` file that tells us:

1. Who you are.

1. How to build and run your program.

We will award monetary bonuses in the form of
[Quatloos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatloo), the currency of the
planet Triskelion, to those who achieve one or more of the following
accomplishments:

* If we can build your project using the standard `cabal` build tool.

* We find your source code to be structured and commented in such a
  way that someone other than you can quickly figure out what is going
  on.

* We run the `hlint` tool over your source code and it reports nothing
  that raises our eyebrows.
  
* You submit a program that we can measure as performing awesomely on
  a (respectably large) data set of our choosing.  Criteria for
  awesomeness will include such things as performance and memory
  footprint.

The winner of the most quatloos gets a special edition JPEG of a pony.
